{"input": "What causes seasonal allergies?", "output": "Seasonal allergies are caused by an immune system overreaction to outdoor allergens like pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds, or mold spores. When these allergens enter the body, the immune system mistakenly identifies them as harmful and produces antibodies that signal the release of chemicals like histamine, causing allergy symptoms. Genetics, environmental factors, and timing of exposure influence susceptibility."}
